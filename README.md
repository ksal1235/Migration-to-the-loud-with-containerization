Migration to the Ð¡loud with containerization

## Project Overview

This project is part of a series that demonstrates how to migrate an application to the cloud using containerization techniques. In this first part, we focus on the fundamentals of Docker and Docker Compose, which are essential tools for containerizing applications.

The goal of this project is to:

1. Understand the basic concepts of Docker, including building and running Docker containers.
2. Learn how to use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
3. Containerize a simple web application and run it using Docker Compose.

## Project Structure
The project folder contains the following files and directories:

* Step 1.md: Covers the basics of Docker, including installing Docker, running Docker containers, and building Docker images.
* Step 2.md: Introduces Docker Compose, explaining how to define and manage multi-container applications.
* Step 3.md: Demonstrates how to containerize a simple web application using Docker and Docker Compose.
* app/: Contains the source code for the sample web application.
* docker/: Includes the Dockerfile used to build the web application image.
* docker-compose.yml: The Docker Compose configuration file for the web application.

## Prerequisites:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Docker: You can download and install Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/get-started
2. Docker Compose: Docker Compose is usually installed along with Docker, but you can also install it separately from the official website: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.

Ensure that you can run basic Docker and Docker Compose commands without any issues.

## Expected Outcomes:

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Understand the basic concepts of Docker, including images, containers, and the Docker command-line interface.
2. Learn how to use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container applications.
3. Containerize a simple web application and run it using Docker Compose.
4. Gain hands-on experience with containerization and explore ways to apply these techniques to your own projects.
